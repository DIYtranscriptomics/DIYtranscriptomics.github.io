Abstract
------------
Pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), sense conserved molecular components of microbes. TLR-4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and activates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and survival proteins. TLR4 can also activate cell death pathways through receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) and/or caspase-8. We have found that *Ripk3^-/-^Casp8^-/-^* cells have a cell-intrinsic defect in expressing TNFa, IL-6 and IL-12p40 in response to infection with the Gram-negative bacteria in vivo. *Ripk3^-/-^Casp8^-/-^* bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) also have a defect in transcription of a number of inflammatory cytokines in response to TLR-2,-3,-4 and -9 stimulation. To study the role of caspase-8 in cytokine production, we performed RNA-seq on  B6, RIPK3-deficient and caspase-8/Ripk3-deficient BMDMs that were untreated or stimulated with LPS for 6hrs. The experiment was conducted in duplicate and the analysis and results are outlined here.
