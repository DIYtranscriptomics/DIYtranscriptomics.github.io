title: 'Annotating gene expression data'
subtitle: 'Lab 4 (required) • February 8, 2023'
date: 2019-01-08 00:00:00
description: At some point we all have to wrestle with gene annotations – that is, all the stuff we can label a gene with. In this lab, you'll learn to access a world of gene-centric annotation data and will practice on gene expression data from non-model organisms.

## Corresponding Lecture

[Lecture 4 - Starting your R workflow](https://diytranscriptomics.com/project/lecture-04)

## Homework

[Homework #1: DataCamp Intro to R course (~2hrs)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) is **due today**!

## Description

[The course dataset](https://diytranscriptomics.com/data) is from human samples.  Annotating human and mouse data is relatively easy, since these organisms are the most well studied, have high quality genomes, and have undergone years of manual curation efforts.  In this lab, you'll work on accessing annotation data from non-human, non-mouse studies.

## What you need to know

Come back soon!  The content for this lab will be posted on or before the date shown at the top of the page.
