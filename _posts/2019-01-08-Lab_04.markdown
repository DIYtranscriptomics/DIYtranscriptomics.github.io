description: At some point we all have to wrestle with gene annotations – that is, all the stuff we can label a gene with. In this lab, you'll learn to access a world of gene-centric annotation data and will practice on gene expression data from non-model organisms.

## Description

[The course dataset](https://diytranscriptomics.com/data) is from human samples.  Annotating human and mouse data is relatively easy, since these organisms are the most well studied, have high quality genomes, and have undergone years of manual curation efforts.  In this lab, we'll talk about how to access annotation data from non-human, non-mouse studies.
