## Description

In this lab, you'll work with an unpublished scRNA-seq dataset, courtesy of [Chris Hunter's lab](https://www.vet.upenn.edu/research/centers-laboratories/research-laboratory/hunter-laboratory).  This scRNA-seq dataset was generated from the brain of a mouse that harbored a chronic infection with the protozoan parasite, *Toxoplasma gondii*.  Chronic infection with this parasite results in latent cysts in the brain.  Immune cells infiltrate the brain in response to this infection, where they produce antimicrobial factors that are critical in limiting parasite growth and catastrophic pathology.
