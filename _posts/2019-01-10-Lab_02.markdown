title: 'Creating and using shell scripts and loops'
subtitle: 'Lab 2 (required) â€¢ January 31, 2024'
date: 2019-01-10 00:00:00
description: Using command-line tools often requires that you run similar code for each of your samples (e.g. read mapping).  In this lab, you'll learn how to automate this redundant process using a simple code-aware text editor, making it possible for you to get work done even when you're not sitting in front of your computer.  How great is that?!
