description: Using command-line tools often requires that you run similar code for each of your samples (e.g. read mapping).  In this lab, you'll learn how to automate this redundant process using a simple code-aware text editor, making it possible for you to get work done even when you're not sitting in front of your computer.  How great is that?!

## Description

In our lecture, we covered the basics for running Kallisto with a single sample.  However, you will rarely, if ever, be dealing with a single sample.  In this lab, we'll work through how to automate alignments and other command-line work using shell scripts and 'for loops'.  To keep the lab moving along, we'll work with very small fastq files.
