description: Using command-line tools often requires that you run similar code for each of your samples (e.g. read mapping).  In this lab, you'll learn how to automate this redundant process using a simple code-aware text editor, making it possible for you to get work done even when you're not sitting in front of your computer.  How great is that?!
