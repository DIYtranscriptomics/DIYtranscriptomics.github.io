title: 'Dumpster diving in RNA-seq data'
subtitle: 'Lab 5 (required) â€¢ February 15, 2023'
date: 2019-01-07 00:00:00
description: What about those reads that didn't map to the human reference? In this lab you'll learn to make the most from your RNA-seq data by digging through these 'junk' unmapped reads.  It turns out that most RNA-seq studies are 'metatranscriptomes'.
