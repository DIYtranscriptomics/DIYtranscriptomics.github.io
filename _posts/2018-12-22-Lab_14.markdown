description: At this point, you've learned the basics of processing and analyzing scRNA-seq data.  In this lab, we'll put those skills to the test with a bizarre and fascinating pathogen...tapeworms.  You'll be looking for stem cells that allow the parasite to generate a seemingly unlimited supply of segements.  Get ready for a wild ride!
