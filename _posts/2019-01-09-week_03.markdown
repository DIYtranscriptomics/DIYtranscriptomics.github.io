## Corresponding lecture

There is no corresponding lecture.  Instead, I'll walk through how to set-up and use Git and Github on your computer.

## If you're new to R

We're approaching the point the class where we'll be making the jump from working in the bash/terminal to working in R/RStudio.  So, if you're completely new to R, please take time to work through [this Learn R! module on the Tidyverse](https://diytranscriptomics.com/learnr/module-03).

## Details of this lab will be made available on the day of the lab
