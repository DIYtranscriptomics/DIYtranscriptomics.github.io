description: Explore a large and multivariate dataset generated from the helmith parasite, Schistosoma mansoni, an important pathogen of humans.  You'll use dimensional reduction to understand how factors like sex, developmental stage, genetic strain and drug treatment contribute to differences in gene expression.

## Description

A colleague has asked for your help to mine data produced from a very large RNAseq study of the parasitc worm, *Schistosoma mansoni*.  In this experiment, male (M), female (F), juvenile (J) and mixed sex (X) worms were recovered from infected mice at various timepoints (control, 3hr, 12hr, and 24hr) following *in vivo* treatment with a low dose of the frontline anti-parasitic drug, praziquantel.  Experiments were carried out with three different strains of worms: NMRI, LE, and LEPZQ.  In total, 144 samples were sequenced!  To begin this challenge, you'll need to download the Kallisto read mapping results and study design file **[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k0959o6luvda69p/schistosoma.zip?dl=0)** and read these data into a new R project.

To succeed at the worm challenge, you will need to use the tools you've learned in class for filtering, normalizing, multivariate analysis with PCA, and data wrangling with dplyr.

## What you need to do

Nothing...at least not yet!  **The content for this lab will be posted on Oct 6th**.  If you're following along virtually, this content will remain up after Oct 6th for anyone to access.
