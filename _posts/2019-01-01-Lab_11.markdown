## Corresponding lecture

We're available to help with anything we've covered up to this point.

## Description

Hooray!  You're done with all the lectures and labs for bulk RNA-seq.  Since the remainder of the course will focus on single cell RNA-seq, this is a good time to resolve any outstanding issues or questions you have about the scripts we've covered up to this point.
