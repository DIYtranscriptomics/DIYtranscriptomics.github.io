title: 'Using generative AI to supercharge your coding'
subtitle: 'Lab 7 (required) â€¢ February 26, 2025'

description: Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing how we interact with code.  In this lab, we'll review the solution for the last lab, but will use AI to guide us.  I'll demonstrate how you can use the AI 'pair programmer' called Github Copilot to much more rapidly and seemlessly start new coding projects.
