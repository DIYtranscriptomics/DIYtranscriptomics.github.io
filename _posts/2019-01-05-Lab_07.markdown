description: Think you know how to wrangle and plot data?  We'll put your skills to the test using a dataframe with millions of rows.  To illustrate the general utility of the methods you've learned thus far in the course, we'll step away from gene expression for this lab and instead explore the import of animals and animal products into US port cities over a 14 year period.
