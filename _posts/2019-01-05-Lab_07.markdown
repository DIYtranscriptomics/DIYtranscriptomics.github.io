description: Think you know how to wrangle and plot data?  We'll put your skills to the test using a dataframe with millions of rows.  To illustrate the general utility of the methods you've learned thus far in the course, we'll step away from gene expression for this lab and instead explore data from a completely different type of study.

## Description

In this lab, you'll tackle data from the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) data on wildlife and wildlife product imports into the United States. This data was obtained via Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by [EcoHealth Alliance](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/) and contains over 5.5 million observations of 28 variables, showing the flow of live wildlife and wildlife products into and out of the USA from 2000-2014.  Given that most infectious diseases have a zoonotic (animal to human) component, this dataset offers critical insight into the potential for the global spread of both human and animal diseases.

An analysis of a portion of this large dataset was published by EcoHealth Alliance [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10393-017-1211-7).
