## Description

You're tasked with studying gene expression in *Plasmodium falciparum*, a single-celled protozoan parasite that infects human red blood cells (RBCs) and is the causative agent of malaria, one of the deadliest infectious diseases on the planet.  After invading an RBC, parasites progress through a 48 hour developmental cycle before rupturing the cell and invading a new one.  To understand how parasite gene expression changes during this cycle, you infect RBCs *in vitro* and isolate RNA every 8 hours for 48 hours straight.  As you're finishing the experiment (and very much looking forward to sleeping), your PI asks if you can put together a figure for a last-minute grant submission.  

## What you need to do
