## Corresponding lecture

There is no corresponding lecture.  Instead, I'll demonstrate some key AI tools and you will be tasked with using these tools during a set of structured in-class exercises.

## If you're new to R

Please take time to work through [this Learn R! module on the Tidyverse](https://diytranscriptomics.com/learnr/module-03)
