# Minimal Mistakes

**[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)** is a two column responsive Jekyll theme perfect for powering your GitHub hosted blog.

**Jekyll 3 Update:** A version of Minimal Mistakes compatible with Jekyll 3 can be found in the [`jekyll3` branch](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/jekyll3). GitHub Pages is [locked at version 2.4](https://pages.github.com/versions/) so some keep that in mind if you're trying to use 3.0 features that aren't supported there yet.

## Minimal Mistakes is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers.
* Minimal embellishments -- content first.
* Optional large feature images for posts and pages.
* Simple and clear permalink structure.
* [Custom 404 page](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/404.html) to get you started.
* Support for Disqus Comments
