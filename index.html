		<h1>Welcome to DIY Transcriptomics</h1>
		<p>A semester-long course covering best practices for the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data from gene expression (RNA-seq) studies, with a primary focus on empowering students to be independent in the use of lightweight and open-source software using the R programming language and the Bioconductor suite of packages.  This course follows a hybrid format in which online lectures are paired with in-person labs where students participate in hands-on, live coding exercises using real â€˜omic datasets. The course is focused on datasets and topics central to infectious disease research, immunology, and One-Health, but the concepts and approaches covered are applicable to any genomic study.</p>
