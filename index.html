		<h1>Welcome to DIY Transcriptomics</h1>
		<p>A hybrid course covering best practices for bulk and single cell RNA-seq data analysis, with a primary focus on empowering students to be independent in the use of lightweight and open-source software and the R/bioconductor environment.  Online curriculum is paired with in-person labs offered as CAMB714 at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Veterinary Medicine.  The course is focused on infectious diseases, but concepts are applicable to any transcriptomics study.</p>
