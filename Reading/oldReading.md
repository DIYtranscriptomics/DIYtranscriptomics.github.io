## Version control with Git

_You'll need the following three items for our in-class Git exercise:_

* [here](http://TranscriptomicsWorkshop.github.io/Reading/files/Git_instructions.pdf) are my instructions to guide you through a version control exercise

* Download [this recipe for chocolate muffins](http://TranscriptomicsWorkshop.github.io/Reading/files/chocolateMuffin.txt) and open it in a text editor.  We'll use this to illustrate version control using the workflow above.

* Here's a [.gitignore](http://TranscriptomicsWorkshop.github.io/Reading/files/gitignore.txt). I'll explain a bit more about this in class

_If you want to learn more about Git, or practice what you've learned, check out the resources below:_

* Got 15 min to spare?  Practice Git right in your browser in [this handy web tool](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) from the folks at Code School

* In this class, we used the Unix terminal to execute Git commands.  If you want to learn more about Unix commands, check out this [Unix & Perl tutorial for Biologists](http://korflab.ucdavis.edu/unix_and_Perl/), from the Korf lab at UC Davis

* A [Git cheat-sheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) with all of the most common commands

* Delve more deeply into version control with [ProGit](http://git-scm.com/book), a free book by Scott Chacon.
