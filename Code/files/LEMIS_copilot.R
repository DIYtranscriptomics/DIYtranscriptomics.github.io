# Introduction ----
# The goal of this script is to analyze data from LEMIS, tracking the import of animals and animal products into US ports.
# We'll use a combination of tidyverse and ggplot2 to explore the data and answer a series of questions.
#
# Load tidyverse and plotly packages ----

# read in lemis data, stored locally as lemis_cleaned.tsv ----

# let's experiment with the prompt above.  What happens if we change .tsv to .csv...or remove these details altogether?

# take a look at the unique levels for any of the variables in this dataset

# Question 1: Identify the most common (by 'quantity') live mammal taken from the wild for import into the US. ----

# Question 2: Building on your analysis above, produce a plot showing live animals (use 'generic_name') imported for the purposes of "scientific" or "Biomedical research"

# make the plot above but interactive using plotly

# Question 3: From which countries do we import macaques? ----

# Question 4: Use a plot to show the countries from which we import live bat? ----

# Question 5: For what 'purpose' are these imported bats used? ----

# Question 6: How does the type of bat (use 'specific_name') imported differ between countries (use 'facet_wrap' in your ggplot code)? ----

# Question 7: Identify the most expensive (by ‘value’) shipment of "Live specimens (live animals or plants)" to enter the US? ----

# Question 8: How does the answer above compare with the most expensive shipment of any kind (live or not)? ----

# Question 9: From which countries are live fruit bats imported? ----

# Question 10: From which countries are Wildebeest hides imported? ----
