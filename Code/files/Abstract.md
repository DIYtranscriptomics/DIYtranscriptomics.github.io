## Experiment Description
We previously showed that TLX is an enhancer of IFN-gamma induced STAT1-mediated transcription and immunity to Toxoplasma infection.  Given the importance of this signaling pathway in macrophage differentiation and activation, we decided to test whether TLX might play a role in the biology of this critical immune cell type.  In this experiment we retrovirally transduced Ckit+ fetal liver cells (purified over magnetic columns) with either control virus, or virus overexpressing TLX.  Cells were then cultured for 5 days under multilineage conditions and cells lineage commitment was assessed by flow cytometry.  We observed that ectopic expression of TLX in cKit+ progenitor cells skewed lineage commitment toward a myeolid fate.  To determine the extent to which TLX modulated the phenotype of macrophages, we purified CD11b+ cells from cultures transduced with control virus ('control'), cultures transduced with control virus and stimulated with IFN-gamma ('IFNG'), and cultures transduced to express TLX ('TLX').  Illumina microarrays were carried on all three populations isolated from three replicate experiments.
