# Introduction to this script ----
# now that you've read your transcript-level or gene-level data into R, you're ready to begin working with your data
# recall that your abundance data are TPM, while the counts are read counts mapping to each gene or transcript
# Our goals in this script are to filter and normalize data
# This script also introduces us ggplot2 for plotting, which let's us appreciate how filtering and normalization impact our data.

# Load packages -----
library(tidyverse) 
library(hrbrthemes) # I really like this package for setting a clean theme for my ggplot2 graphs.
library(RColorBrewer) # provides access to color palettes for graphics
library(reshape2) # for reshaping dataframes
library(genefilter) # as the package name suggests, it's for filtering genes
library(edgeR) # also for differential expression, but we only use for the DGEList object
library(matrixStats) # let's us easily calculate stats on any matrix rows or columns

# Identify variables of interest in study design file ----
targets
groups1 <- targets$treatment
groups2 <- targets$treatment2
groups1 <- factor(groups1)
groups2 <- factor(groups2)
sampleLabels <- targets$sample

# Examine your data up to this point ----
myCPM <- Txi_gene$abundance
myCounts <- Txi_gene$counts
# let's quickly graph both matrices to see what we're dealing with

colSums(myCPM)
colSums(myCounts)

# Take a look at the heteroskedasticity of the data ----
# first, calculate row means and standard deviations for each transcript or gene 
# and add these to your data matrix
myCPM.stats <- transform(myCPM, 
                         SD=rowSds(myCPM), 
                         AVG=rowMeans(myCPM),
                         MED=rowMedians(myCPM)
                         )

# Make a DGElist from your counts, and plot ----

# take a look at the DGEList object 
myDGEList
#DEGList objects are a good R data file to consider saving to you working directory

  theme_modern_rc() #another cool theme from the hrbrthemes package, but won't work until you've downloaded some additional fonts for your OS

  # what do you think of the distribution of this data?

# Filter your data ----
