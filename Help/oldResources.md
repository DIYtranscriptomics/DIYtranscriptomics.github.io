* **[Genomics Hackathon](https://github.com/VahediLab/IFIGeneticsHackathon_2016)** - led by [Golnaz Vahedi](http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g20001881/p8837265), an Assistant Professor of Genetics at the Perelman School of Medicine.  This two-day event will be held in April 2016 (dates to be determined) and is geared toward IGG students already engaged in the use of pipelines for genomic analyses from next generation sequencing data OR those with no bioinformatics background planning to take the highly effective HarvardX Course prior to the event. Working groups of 2 individuals will be formed and these groups will build pipelines to analyze large datasets including but not limited to ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq.  After a brief organizational session, teams will spend two days analyzing a challenging set of scientific problems related to a group of datasets. Participants will analyze and combine datasets in order to work on these problems. This course will take place on UPenn campus. Pizza and beer will be provided.
