## Experiment Description
Infection with Leishmania braziliensis can lead to immunopathology in patients, much more severe than other species of Leishmania. Unlike what is seen in patients, mouse models of infection with L. braziliensis triggers a rather mild disease that heals spontaneously. Infection with Leishmania major, however, causes severe skin lesions in C57BL/6 that eventualy resolves infection or non-healing lesions in BALB/c mice. In order to understand why L. braziliensis controls infection in both C57BL/6 and BALB/c we performed a transcriptional profiling of C57BL/6 and BALB/c infected with either L. braziliensis, L. major or uninfected.
