Everyone is expected to bring their own internet-enabled laptop equiped with either the recent Mac or Windows OS. All the software listed below is free and we will help you install each program during class.

## Part I
* Download and install the current version of the [R Programming Language](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/) for your operating system
* Download and install the graphical user interface for R, called [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* Download a powerfull text editor. I use [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* If you have a Mac, download the latest version of [XCode developer tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)  
* If you have a PC, download [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) to give your system many linux-like capabilities
* Here are my [instructions for installing Kallisto](https://chmi-sops.github.io/mydoc_kallisto.html),the program we'll use for mapping reads to transcripts. *We will install this program together in class*

## Part II
* Download the Java-based program for running [GSEA](http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp). This requires that you sign-up for a free account. You may also need to update to the latest version of [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) for this application to run properly. 
* Download the network analysis platform, [Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/)
