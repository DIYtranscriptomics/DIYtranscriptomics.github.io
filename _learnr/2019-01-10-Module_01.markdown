## Overview

In the first half of this lecture we'll discuss the open-source, cross-platform R programming language.  Then each student will set-up their own laptop with the newest version of R and RStudio, as well as several other tools that are generally useful for working with code.

---

## Learning objectives

* Brief overview of R, RStudio, and Bioconductor
* Set-up *your* laptop with all the software you'll need for working in R

---

## Software everyone will need

**I'll walk you through installing the following software**

[R Programming Language](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/) - The only programming language we'll work with in class.

[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) - a development environment for the R programming language.

[Sublime text editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - a simple but powerful text editor that is 'code aware'

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - an excellent choice for working with virtually any kind of code outside of RStudio.  We'll use this later in the semester for connecting to and working with GitHub repositories.
