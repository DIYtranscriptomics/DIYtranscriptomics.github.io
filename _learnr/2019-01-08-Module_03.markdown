## Overview

In the first half part of this module, you'll watch a video that walks through the basics of using the Tidyverse ecosystem of R packages for data science.  Then, you'll complete an active coding lesson in Datacamp

---

## Learning objectives

* Learn about the Tidyverse ecosystem of packages and functions
* Know the basic dplyr 'verbs' and how to use them to work with data frames
* Know what makes data tidy or messy, and how and when to move between these two states
* Understand the utility of the %>% pipe operator

## Files you'll need

Download the files below and place them on your desktop.  If any of these files do not download when you click on them, simply right-click and choose 'copy link address', then open a new browser tab, paste the path into your web-browser URL bar, and hit enter.

[R script](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Code/files/bootcamp.R) - I'll use this script in the first video to demonstrate key basic concepts in R

[swine_study.txt](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Data/files/swine_study.txt) - a simple text file that we'll use as an example of working with dataframes

[matrix.txt](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Data/files/matrix.txt) - a simple data matrix that we'll also use in the script above.

## Reading (optional)

[Tidy Data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) - Hadley Wickham (author of Tidyverse packages and Chief Scientist at RStudio) describes the philosophy of tidy data in this paper.
