## Overview

In the first half part of this module you'll watch a video that walks through the basics of using ggplot2, a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics.  Then, you'll complete two active coding lesson in Datacamp.

## Reading (optional)

[Grammar of graphics](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Reading/files/layered-grammar.pdf) - Another paper by Hadley Wickham.  This one explains the rationale behind ggplot2.

[ggplot2 cheatsheet](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Reading/files/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) – a very helpful guide as we continue to use ggplot2 for all of our plotting needs.
