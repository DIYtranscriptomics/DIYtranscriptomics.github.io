## Overview

In the first half part of this module you'll watch a video that walks through the basics of using ggplot2, a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics.  Then, you'll complete two active coding lesson in Datacamp.

## Learning objectives

* Understand the advantages of a layered grammar of graphics
* Understand and be able to modfiy the basic code for producing plots with ggplot2
* Understand themes for ggplot2
* Know how to find and use colors in creating graphics in R

## Reading (optional)

[The Grammar of Graphics, Second Edition](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28695-0) - This 2005 book makes the philosophy and application of a grammar for graphics.  A critical book in dataviz.

[A Layered Grammar of graphics](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Reading/files/layered-grammar.pdf) - Seminal 2010 paper by Hadley Wickham that builds on Wilkinson's work above and introduces ggplot2 and the concept of a layered grammar for graphics in R.

[ggplot2 cheatsheet](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Reading/files/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) – a very helpful guide as we continue to use ggplot2 for all of our plotting needs.

[Gallery of ggplot2 graphics](https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html) - Take a look at some of the various ways to graph your data and the underlying R code.

[R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/) - If you end up using R to make a lot of graphs, you will find this book to be an important reference. It's free too!
