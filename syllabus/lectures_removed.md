**May 19th** *note change of day* - In the first half of this lecture we'll discuss the open-source, cross-platform software that will be used throughout the course, and each student will set-up their own laptop to be a powerful, stand-alone bioinformatics workstation.  In preparation for this class, you'll need to download and install the [R Programming Language](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/) for your operating system, the graphical user interface for R, called [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), the powerfull text editor [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/), and the version control system, called [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads).  Don't know what any of these things are?  Not to worry, we'll delve into these tools the next time we meet.  Lecture slides available [here](http://bit.ly/1ToDM3R).
