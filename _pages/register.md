If you're a postdoc, you cannot formally register for the course, but instead should reach out to Dan Beiting (beiting@upenn.edu) to express interest and find out about how to secure a seat in the course.  interested in taking the course, please complete the google form below.  Completing this form serves to pre-register you but *does not* guarantee you a slot in the class.  Seats and teaching assistants are limited, though we try to accomodate as many students as possible.  All those who pre-register will receive confirmation by email approximately 2 weeks prior to the scheduled start of the course to confirm enrollment.
