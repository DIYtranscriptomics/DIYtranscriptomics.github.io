If you're interested in taking the course, please complete the google form below.  Completing this form serves to pre-register you but *does not* guarantee you a slot in the class.  Seats and teaching assistants are limited, though we try to accomodate as many students as possible.  All those who pre-register will receive confirmation by email approximately 2 weeks prior to the scheduled start of the course to confirm enrollment. 

**Note** - this course is not for credit. Enrollment is voluntary.  If you are a graduate student, you can inquire with your graduate group to request credit for the course as an independent study.
