## Bring your own data

You'll get the most from this class if you B.Y.O.D. -- Bring your own data.  Nothing will keep you more enagaged and crystalize the content of the course quite like working on questions you *actually* care about.  That said, it is not a requirement that you come with data in hand.  Throughout the course, I will demonstrate every step in the analysis using a 'real' dataset, which you can download below and use to follow along with me in class.  If you run into serious problems following along with your own data, I strongly recommend that you use the dataset provided below.  You can always return to your data once you have a functional pipeline and understand the process.  


## Course dataset

You *do not* need to use your own data in the course.  I will make an RNAseq dataset available to everyone, and all scripts will be structured with this shared dataset in mind.  The course dataset will be announced and discussed at the start of the course
