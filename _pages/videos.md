## Videos 

Video recordings are available on each lecture page under the syllabus tab.  You can also checkout the full set of videos by heading over to our [Vimeo Showcase](https://vimeo.com/showcase/6565319).

## Tips for watching videos

* Use the speed controls (available under the gear icon in each video) to slow or speed up the video as needed.
* Most lectures are split into two videos to help break-up the content for an easier viewing experience.
