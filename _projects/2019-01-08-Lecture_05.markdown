No lecture slides for this class.  We'll spend the entire time working on Step 1 script.

[Homework: Introduction to the Tidyverse (~4hrs)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse) - due before the start of class on March 6th.


## Overview

We'll begin this class by reviewing how to access R packages and help documentation, as well as understanding the basic structure of a script. We'll then access annotation data before reading our Kallisto results into R.  Our class concludes with discussing study design and using Sleuth for differentially transcript expression analysis.

## Goals

* Review basic elements of our scripts
* Access annotation data using the Biomart package
* View Kallisto results using Sleuth
* Read Kallisto transcript abundance measurements into the R environment using TxImport

## Reading

[Differential analysis of RNA-seq incorporating quantification uncertainty. Nature Methods, June, 2017](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Reading/files/sleuth.pdf) - Original paper describing Sleuth

[Lior Pachter's blog post on Sleuth](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2015/08/17/a-sleuth-for-rna-seq/)

[vignette for the Tximport package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/tximport/inst/doc/tximport.html) - the R package we'll use to read the Kallisto mapping results into R.

[Differential analyses for RNA-seq: transcript-level estimates improve gene-level inferences](http://f1000research.com/articles/4-1521/v2)* F1000Research, Dec 2015. This paper describes the Tximport package and its application for handling transcript-level expression measurments from lightweight aligners (Salmon, Sailfish, Kallisto)
