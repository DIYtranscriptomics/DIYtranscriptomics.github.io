No lecture slides for this class.  We spent the entire time working on Step 1 script.

[Homework: Introduction to the Tidyverse (~4hrs)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse) - due before the start of class on March 6th.

## Overview

Now that we've aligned our reads, it's time to discuss units for measuring gene expression.  We'll discuss differences between RPKM and TPM, and how these units relate to basic properties of your experiment.  We'll also discuss normalization *within* and *between* samples.  To conclude this class, we'll read our Kallisto data into the R environment.

## Goals

* Review basic elements of our scripts
* View Kallisto results using Sleuth
* Read our transcript abundance measurements into the R environment using TxImport
