No lecture slides for this class.  We'll spend the entire time working on Step 1 script.

[Homework: Introduction to the Tidyverse (~4hrs)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse) - due before the start of class on Friday, May 1st.


## Overview

We'll begin this class by reviewing how to access R packages and help documentation, as well as understanding the basic structure of an R script and RStudio project. We'll then access annotation data before reading our Kallisto results into R.  

## Learning objectives

* Review basic elements of an R script
* Understand the importance of a study design file
* Learn how to access R packages, and their help documentation
* Read Kallisto transcript abundance measurements into the R environment using TxImport

## Code

[vignette for the Tximport package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/tximport/inst/doc/tximport.html) - the R package we'll use to read the Kallisto mapping results into R.
