## Overview

After a brief overview of the course, we'll spend the opening lecture talking about Illumina's 'Sequencing by Synthesis' technology, and walk through the steps involved in planning for a transcriptomics experiment.  After this lecture, jargon like flow cell, single-end, paired-end, indexing, cluster density, library, ribo-depletion, scRNAseq, and fastq will pratically roll off your tongue.

## Goals

* Familiarity with Illumina's 'Sequencing by Synthesis' (SBS) technology
* Basics of setting up a sequencing experiment (read length vs depth, PE vs SE, etc.)
* Understand data output from HTS


## Reading

[File formats produced by sequencing](http://binf.snipcademy.com/lessons/sequence-file-formats).

[RNA-seqlopedia](http://rnaseq.uoregon.edu/) - Created by the Univ. of Orgeon, this is a great resource for understanding the entire RNAseq workflow.

## Videos 

Illumina's SBS technology - Below is the video I showed in class.  It's a nice visual for how SBS works.
