[Homework #1: DataCamp Intro to R course (~2hrs)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) - due 3pm next Wednesday, April 22nd.

## Overview

After a brief overview of the course, we'll spend the opening lecture talking about Illumina's 'Sequencing by Synthesis' technology, and walk through the steps involved in planning for a transcriptomics experiment.  After this lecture, jargon like flow cell, single-end, paired-end, indexing, cluster density, library, ribo-depletion, scRNAseq, and fastq will practically roll off your tongue.

---

## Learning objectives

* Get familiar with jargon of RNAseq/HTS (paired-end, cluster density, fastq, index, etc)
* Understand Illumina’s “Sequencing by Synthesis” (SBS) technology
* Set priorities when planning a sequencing experiment
* Understand the basics of library prep
* Have sense for how single cell sequencing (scRNAseq) and spatial transcriptomics fit into the evolving landscape of transcriptomics

## Reading

[File formats produced by sequencing](http://binf.snipcademy.com/lessons/sequence-file-formats).

[RNA-seqlopedia](http://rnaseq.uoregon.edu/) - Created by the Univ. of Orgeon, this is a great resource for understanding the entire RNAseq workflow.
