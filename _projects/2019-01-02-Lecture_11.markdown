description: Coordinately expressed genes, or modules, often contain a more coherent functional signature.  We'll discuss strategies for clustering expression data to identify these modules, setting the stage for downstream function enrichment analysis to be covered in the next class.

## Overview

Lists of differentially expressed transcripts often include different patterns or modules of genes that are coordinately regulated across treatments or conditions, and these patterns can provide powerful insight into biology.  In this class you'll use correlation-based clustering methods and heatmap visualization to interrogate DEGs to reveal modules of co-regulated genes.

## Goals

* Learn how to produce static and interactive heatmaps
* Learn to use correlation methods and the gplots package to identify co-expression modules

## Reading

If you want to try a clustering method outside of R, check out the Clust program: [Clust: automatic extraction of optimal co-expressed gene clusters from gene expression data. Genome Biology, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-018-1536-8).

**Colors in R** - Colors palettes are an often underappreciated aspect of making beautiful and informative plots in R. You can access a suite of color palettes using the [RColorBrewer package](http://colorbrewer2.org).  These palettes can be viewed in [this cheatsheet](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Reading/files/colorbrewerPalettes.pdf).  Unfortunately, these standard palettes often don't cut it, and you'll need custom palettes. For this, I love using [Sip](https://sipapp.io/) to pick, organize and access color palettes.
