## Overview

In the first half of this lecture we'll discuss the open-source, cross-platform R/bioconductor software and environment that will be used throughout the course, and each student will set-up their own laptop to be a powerful, stand-alone bioinformatics workstation. 

## Learning objectives

* Brief overview of the tools we’ll use throughout the course (R/Bioconductor, RStudio, etc.)
* Set-up *your* laptop with all the software needed for the course

## Software

**I'll walk you through installing the following software**

[R Programming Language](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/) - The only programming language we'll work with in class.

[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) - a development environment for the R programming language.

[Sublime text editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - a simple but powerful text editor that is 'code aware'

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - an alternative to Sublime and an excellent choice for working with scripts outside of RStudio.

[XCode developer tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - *Only download if running on Mac OS on your laptop.*

[Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) - *Only download if running a Windows OS on your laptop.*  Cygwin will give your system more linux-like capabilities

[Kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/) - This is the software we'll use for mapping raw reads to a reference transcriptome.  Detailed instructions for installing and using Kallisto are available on my lab's SOP site [here](https://chmi-sops.github.io/mydoc_kallisto.html).
