## Overview

In order to make your analysis pipeline transparent and reproducible, in this class you'll use [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) to wrap up all your code and outputs (figures, tables, etc) together in a dyanmic document that can be placed in your lab notebook or published as a supplementary file in your manuscript.

## Goals

* learn the basics of Rmarkdown and dynamic documents
* learn how to construct a basic R markdown document
* use the 'essential' code chunks from the course to populate an Rmarkdown report
* make a flexdashboard the incorporates graphics and code

## Code

[Rmarkdown_template.Rmd](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Code/files/Rmarkdown_template.Rmd) - a skeletal template that you can fill out with the code 'essentials' that we covered in class.

[Rmarkdown_cryptoProj.Rmd](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Code/files/Rmarkdown_cryptoProj.Rmd) - same template as above, but already filled in with essentials

[flexdashboard_template.Rmd](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Code/files/flexdashboard_template.Rmd) - a different style of Rmarkdown that puts the focus on creating a dashboard of graphics.  Particularly powerful when combined with the interactive graphs we produced during the course.

[flexdashboard_cryptoProj.Rmd](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Code/files/flexdashboard_cryptoProj.Rmd) - a dashboard that incorporates plots for the crypto project
