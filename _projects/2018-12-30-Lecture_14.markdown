description: Distilling genomic data to create clear and compelling figures is a major challenge, but is essential for publication and grants.  In this lecture you'll learn about the basic building blocks of an gene expression figure and how the plots you've produced thus far form the basis for telling a story with your data.  You'll also learn about best practices for graphic design and typography for making figures that are not only clear, but also look great.

## Overview

Distilling genomic data to create clear and compelling figures is a major challenge, but is essential for publication and grants.  In this lecture you'll learn about the basic building blocks of an gene expression figure and how the plots you've produced thus far form the basis for telling a story with your data.  You'll also learn about best practices for graphic design and typography for making figures that are not only clear, but also look great.

## Goals

* learn the basic building blocks of an RNAseq figure
* Assemble a figure from plots you've generated
* Discuss design properties in R, including color, typography and ggplot themes
* How to construct figures in R

## Software

[Sip](https://sipapp.io/) - I discussed this simple but excellent color picking software in class. The program costs about $10, but provides a convenient and powerful way to assemble color palettes for use in R.

## Reading

[Colors in R]() 

Colors palettes are an often underappreciated aspect of making beautiful and informative plots in R. You can access a suite of color palettes using the [RColorBrewer package](http://colorbrewer2.org).  These palettes can be viewed in [this cheatsheet](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Reading/files/colorbrewerPalettes.pdf).  Unfortunately, these standard palettes often don't cut it, and you'll need custom palettes. For this, I love using [Sip](https://sipapp.io/) to pick, organize and access color palettes.
