## Overview

In order to make your analysis pipeline transparent and reproducible, in this class you'll use [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) to wrap up all your code and outputs (figures, tables, etc) together in a dyanmic document that can be placed in your lab notebook or published as a supplementary file in your manuscript.

## Goals

* understand how to construct a basic R markdown document
* transform our course code into an Rmarkdown report
* make an interactive Rmarkdown flexdashboard to display your data

## Code

[The essentials]() - brings togther 'the essential' code chunks from our previous scripts.
