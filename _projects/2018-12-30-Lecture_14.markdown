## Overview

In order to document the code and results from a bioinformatics workflow you'll be introduced to [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), and will use these tools to wrap up all your code and outputs (figures, tables, etc) together in a dyanmic document that can be placed in your lab notebook or published as a supplementary file in your manuscript.

## Learning objectives

* learn the basics of Rmarkdown and dynamic documents
* learn how to construct a basic R markdown document
* use the 'essential' code chunks from the course to populate an Rmarkdown report
* make a flexdashboard the incorporates graphics and code

## Code

[Rmarkdown_template.Rmd](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Code/files/Rmarkdown_template.Rmd) - a skeletal template that you can fill out with the code 'essentials' that we covered in class.

[Rmarkdown_essentials.Rmd](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Code/files/Rmarkdown_essentials.Rmd) - same template as above, but already filled in with essentials

[flexdashboard_essentials.Rmd](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Code/files/flexdashboard_essentials.Rmd) - a different style of Rmarkdown that puts the focus on creating a dashboard of graphics.  Particularly powerful when combined with the interactive graphs we produced during the course.
