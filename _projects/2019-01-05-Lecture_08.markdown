## Overview

In this class we’ll discuss how you can use R/Bioconductor to tap into vast amounts of RNAseq data available through the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). 

## Goals

* Learn about ```fasterq_dump```
* Learn about HDF5 file format
* Explore ARCHS4 database programatically 

## Code

[Step 4 script](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Code/files/Step4_publicData.R)

## Downloads

[ARCHS4 data in HDF5 format](https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/archs4/download.html) - Download the *human_matrix.h5 v6* and the *mouse_matrix.h5 v6*.  These HDF5 files contain RNAseq data already aligned using Kallisto for 133,776 and 170,010 samples, respectively.  Note that each of these files will take about 4Gb of space on your hard-drive. 



## Reading

[Massive mining of publicly available RNA-seq data from human and mouse. Nature Communications, April, 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03751-6).  Describes the ARCHS4 resource from Avi Ma'ayan's lab that provides web and R/bioconductor access to public RNAseq datasets from human and mouse,prealigned with Kallisto.

[Activity of Uncleaved Caspase-8 Controls Anti-bacterial Immune Defense and TLR-Induced Cytokine Production Independent of Cell Death, Oct, 2016](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1005910).  This paper contains the data we'll retrieve from a public gene expression repository.  The data is available [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86922)
