## Overview

In this class we’ll discuss how you can use R/Bioconductor to tap into vast amounts of RNAseq data available through the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and other resources.

## Goals

* Learn about ```fasterq_dump```
* Explore ARCHS4 database programatically 
* Discuss and explore LINCS L1000 database

## Code

[Step 4 script](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Code/files/Step4_publicData.R)

## Reading

[Massive mining of publicly available RNA-seq data from human and mouse. Nature Communications, April, 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03751-6).  Describes the ARCHS4 resource from Avi Ma'ayan's lab that provides web and R/bioconductor access to public RNAseq datasets from human and mouse,prealigned with Kallisto.

[A Next Generation Connectivity Map: L1000 Platform and the First 1,000,000 Profiles. Cell, Nov, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049).  Describes the development and use of a low-cost, reduced representation gene profiling method, termed L1000, applied to 1.3 million samples spanning many difference cell types, stimuli and timepoints.
