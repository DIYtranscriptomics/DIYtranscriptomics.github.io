description: Reproducing an analysis requires more than just code. You need the original raw data, access to the appropriate programming languages, and application specific packages (and often specific versions of these packages).  This poses a major impediment to reproducibility, even for researchers with a background in bioinformatics.  To address this challenge, you'll learn how to 'containerize'  your data, scripts and software into a code timecapsule, making it easy to share and rerun an entire analysis with the push of a button.

## Overview

Reproducing an analysis requires more than just code. You need the original raw data, access to the appropriate programming languages, and application specific packages (and often specific versions of these packages).  This poses a major impediment to reproducibility, even for researchers with a background in bioinformatics.  To address this challenge, you'll learn how to 'containerize'  your data, scripts and software into a code timecapsule, making it easy to share and rerun an entire analysis with the push of a button.  

## Goals

* Review the answer for hackdash #2
* Discuss the basics of Docker and containerized software
* Create a simple Docker file
* Create your own CodeOcean account
* Interact with the CodeOcean capsule for the course
