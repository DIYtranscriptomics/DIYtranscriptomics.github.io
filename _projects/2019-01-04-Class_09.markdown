description: You may have heard of a Hackathon before - an event that typically lasts several days and brings together people for a collaborative challenge in computer programming.  Well, we don't quite have time for a full Hackathon, so we'll do a mad dash to the finish line instead.  This 2hr in-class assignment will test your ability to use recent class material and code to solve a problem in a real RNAseq dataset.
