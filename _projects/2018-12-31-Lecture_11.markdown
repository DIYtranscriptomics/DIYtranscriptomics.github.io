## Overview

In order to document the code and results from a bioinformatics workflow you'll be introduced to [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), and will use these tools to wrap up all your code and outputs (figures, tables, etc) together in a dyanmic document that can be placed in your lab notebook or published as a supplementary file in your manuscript.

## Learning objectives

* Discuss the basic building blocks for assembling a figure
* Understand the basics of Rmarkdown and dynamic documents
* Learn how to construct an Rmarkdown doc using 'essential' code chunks from the course.
* make a flexdashboard the incorporates graphics and code

## Code

[Rmarkdown_template.Rmd](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f1c610tx0360cbd/Rmarkdown_template.Rmd?dl=0) - a skeletal template that you can fill out with the code 'essentials' that we covered in class.

[Rmarkdown_essentials.Rmd](https://www.dropbox.com/s/elui0r4x3uoxvzw/Rmarkdown_essentials.Rmd?dl=0) - same template as above, but already filled in with essentials

[flexdashboard_essentials.Rmd](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pp1oow3u8wnfp2i/flexdashboard_essentials.Rmd?dl=0) - a different style of Rmarkdown that puts the focus on creating a dashboard of graphics.  Particularly powerful when combined with the interactive graphs we produced during the course.
