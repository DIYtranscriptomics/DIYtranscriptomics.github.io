## Overview

In order to document the code and results from a bioinformatics workflow you'll be introduced to [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), and will use these tools to wrap up all your code and outputs (figures, tables, etc) together in a dyanmic document that can be placed in your lab notebook or published as a supplementary file in your manuscript.

## Learning objectives

* Discuss the basic building blocks for assembling a figure
* Understand the basics of Rmarkdown and dynamic documents
* Learn how to construct an Rmarkdown doc using 'essential' code chunks from the course.
* make a flexdashboard the incorporates graphics and code

## Code

[Rmarkdown_template.Rmd](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Code/files/Rmarkdown_template.Rmd) - a skeletal template that you can fill out with the code 'essentials' that we covered in class.

[Rmarkdown_essentials.Rmd](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Code/files/Rmarkdown_essentials.Rmd) - same template as above, but already filled in with essentials

[flexdashboard_essentials.Rmd](http://DIYtranscriptomics.github.io/Code/files/flexdashboard_essentials.Rmd) - a different style of Rmarkdown that puts the focus on creating a dashboard of graphics.  Particularly powerful when combined with the interactive graphs we produced during the course.

[Make your own CV in markdown](https://github.com/dpbisme/CV_rmarkdown) - uses the [Vitae](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/vitae) and [Scholar](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scholar/vignettes/scholar.html) packages in R. Here's mine on github

[This course website!](https://github.com/DIYtranscriptomics/DIYtranscriptomics.github.io) - Each page on the course website is just a simple markdown document. 

[My lab website](http://hostmicrobe.org/) is just a bunch of markdown files served from github (repo [here](https://github.com/hostmicrobe/hostmicrobe.github.io))
