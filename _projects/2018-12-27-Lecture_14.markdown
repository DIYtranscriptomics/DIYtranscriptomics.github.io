No lecture slides for this class.  We'll spend the entire time working on scRNA-seq script.

## Overview

- Other considerations (no one-size-fits-all for filtering...eg. intestine vs mln, different clustering algos give different results)
- enrichment analysis on scRNAseq
- label transfer (maybe demo with MLN in lecture and then have them transfer labels to Ileum)
- cell cycle regression
- Subclustering
- Pseudobulking
- CellChat - cell/cell communication
