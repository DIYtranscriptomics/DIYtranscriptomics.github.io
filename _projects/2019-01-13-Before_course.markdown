Although there are no formal prerequisties for the course and no official course text book, there are a few important housekeeping things you'll need to take care of before the first class.  **Scroll down to the bottom of the page and watch the introductory video.**

## Please complete before the first class

**[Get access to course DataCamp portal](https://www.datacamp.com/)**.  You will receive an email from us with a link to access the course portal on the datacamp site. If you already have a DataCamp account under your UPenn email, then this account will be granted access to the course portal.  DataCamp is a online learning environment that is used throughout the course for homework assignments.  This is a subscription service that is being provided to you free-of-charge (courtesy of DataCamp) only during the current course, so take full advantage to explore any other learning materials on the site. 

[Download and sign-up for Slack](https://slack.com/), a messaging platform we will use heavily during the course.  *All course communication will happen through Slack, not email*.  Questions related to material covered in a lecture should be posted to the specific Slack channel associated with that lecture.  Questions will be reviewed by the TAs and used as guidance for TA help sessions.  The Slack page comes equipped with standard messaging capabilities, but also includes video and voice calling features, as well as screensharing, making it easy for you to connect with your classmates and instructors when you have problems or questions.

## Other useful info

The course website is meant to be the go-to place for all content related to the course, including lecture slides, recordings, reading material, code and more.  Below are some additional resources that I will refer to throughout class.

[Protocols website](https://chmi-sops.github.io/) - This is where my lab posts all protocols/SOPs for RNAseq library preparation, as well as bioinformatics workflows.

## Welcome video
