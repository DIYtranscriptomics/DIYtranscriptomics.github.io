Although there are no formal prerequisties for the course, and no official course text book, there are some important materials listed below that you will need to complete before the first class meets. 

## Please complete before the first class

**[Get access to course DataCamp portal]()**.  You will receive an email from us with a link to access the site. If you already have a DataCamp account under your UPenn email, then this account will be granted access to the course portal.  DataCamp is a online learning environment that is used throughout the course for homework assignments.  This is a subscription service that is being provided to you free-of-charge (courtesy of DataCamp) only during the Fall Semester, so take full advantage to explore any other learning materials on the site. 

[Download and sign-up for Slack](https://slack.com/), a messaging platform we will use heavily during the course.  *All course communication will happen through Slack, not email*.  You will also be able to direclty message the TAs, the instructor or other students through Slack.

## Other useful info

The course website is meant to be the go-to place for all content related to the course, including lecture slides, recordings, reading material, code and more.  Below are some additional resources that I will refer to throughout class.

[Protcols website](https://chmi-sops.github.io/) - This is where my lab posts all protocols/SOPs for RNAseq library preparation, as well as bioinformatics workflows.
