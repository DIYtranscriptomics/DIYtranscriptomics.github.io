Although there are no formal prerequisties for the course, and no official course text book, there are some important materials listed below that you will need to complete before the first class meets. 

## Please complete before the first class

* Check your email for an invitation link to the course [DataCamp]() portal.  This is a online learning environment that is used throughout the course for homework assignments.  This is a subscription service that is being provided to you free-of-charge (courtesy of DataCamp), and you are free to explore any other learning materials on the site.  So have fun!

* Download [Slack](https://slack.com/), a messaging platform we will use heavily during the course.  *All course communication will happen through Slack, not email*.  You will also be able to direclty message the TAs, the instructor or other students through Slack.

* All students must complete [this skills survey](https://forms.gle/wMJ3Kjuaxxd7Ktwr6).


## Other useful info

The course website is meant to be the go-to place for all content related to the course, including lecture slides, recordings, reading material, code and more.  Below are some additional resources that I will refer to throughout class.

[Protcols website](https://chmi-sops.github.io/) - This is where my lab posts all protocols/SOPs for RNAseq library preparation, as well as bioinformatics workflows.
