Although there are no formal prerequisties for the course and no official course text book, there are a few important housekeeping things you'll need to take care of before the first class.

## Please complete before the first class

**[Get access to course DataCamp portal](https://www.datacamp.com/)**.  You will receive an email from us with a link to access the course portal on the datacamp site. If you already have a DataCamp account under your UPenn email, then this account will be granted access to the course portal.  DataCamp is a online learning environment that is used throughout the course for homework assignments.  This is a subscription service that is being provided to you free-of-charge (courtesy of DataCamp) only during the current course, so take full advantage to explore any other learning materials on the site. 

[Download and sign-up for Slack](https://slack.com/), a messaging platform we will use heavily during the course.  *All course communication will happen through Slack, not email*.  You will also be able to direclty message the TAs, the instructor or other students through Slack.

## Other useful info

The course website is meant to be the go-to place for all content related to the course, including lecture slides, recordings, reading material, code and more.  Below are some additional resources that I will refer to throughout class.

[Protocols website](https://chmi-sops.github.io/) - This is where my lab posts all protocols/SOPs for RNAseq library preparation, as well as bioinformatics workflows.
