## Overview

In the first half of this lecture we'll discuss the open-source, cross-platform R/bioconductor software that we will use throughout the course.  Then each student will set-up their own laptop to be a powerful, stand-alone bioinformatics workstation.

## Learning objectives

* Brief overview of the tools we’ll use throughout the course (R/Bioconductor, RStudio, etc.)
* Set-up *your* laptop with all the software needed for the course

## Software everyone will need

**I'll walk you through installing the following software**

[R Programming Language](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/) - The only programming language we'll work with in class.

[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) - a development environment for the R programming language.

[Sublime text editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - a simple but powerful text editor that is 'code aware'

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - an excellent choice for working with virtually any kind of code outside of RStudio.  We'll use this later in the semester for connecting to and working with GitHub repositories.

## Additional software **Mac users** *will* need

[XCode developer tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - *Only download if running Mac OS on your laptop.*

## Additional software **Windows** users *will* need

[Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) - Cygwin will give your system more linux-like capabilities

[Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) – This will give you a bash emulator that works really nicely for running standard command-line programs.

[Kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/) - This is the software we'll use for mapping raw reads to a reference transcriptome.  Detailed instructions for installing and using Kallisto and other course-related software is available on my lab's protocols site [here](https://protocols.hostmicrobe.org/conda).
