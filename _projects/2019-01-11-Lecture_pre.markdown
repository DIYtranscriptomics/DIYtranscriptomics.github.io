As the inaugural lecture for the course, we'll spend this lecture discussing Illumina's 'Sequencing by Synthesis' technology.  We'll also walk through the steps involved in planning for a transcriptomics experiment.  After this lecture, jargon like flow cell, single-end, paired-end, indexing, cluster density, library, ribo-depletion, scRNAseq, and fastq will practically roll off your tongue.

## Learning objectives

* Get familiar with jargon of RNAseq/HTS (paired-end, cluster density, fastq, index, etc)
* Understand Illumina’s “Sequencing by Synthesis” (SBS) technology
* Set priorities when planning a sequencing experiment
* Understand the basics of library prep for HTS

## Reading

[File formats produced by sequencing](https://learn.gencore.bio.nyu.edu/ngs-file-formats/).

[RNA-seqlopedia](http://rnaseq.uoregon.edu/) - Created by the Univ. of Orgeon, this is a great resource for understanding the entire RNAseq workflow.
