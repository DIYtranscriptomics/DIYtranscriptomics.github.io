No lecture slides for this class.  We'll spend the entire time working on Step 1 script.

## Overview

We'll begin this class by reviewing how to access R packages and help documentation, as well as understanding the basic structure of an R script and RStudio project. We'll then access annotation data before reading our Kallisto results into R.

## Learning objectives

* Review basic elements of an R script
* Learn how to access R packages, and their help documentation
* Understand the importance of a study design file
* Access annotation information for transcripts using Bioconductor
* Read Kallisto transcript abundance measurements into the R environment using TxImport
