No lecture slides for this class.  We'll spend the entire time working on Step 2 script.

[Homework: Introduction to the Tidyverse (~4hrs)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse) - due before the start of class on March 6th.


## Overview

We'll begin this class by filtering and normalzing our data, all while using the ggplot2 graphing package to visualize the impact these changes have our data. You'll also be introduced to Hadley Wickham's [dplyr](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) package along with other tools from his [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) of tools to take control over our gene expression dataframes, allowing us to change, sort, filter, arrange and summarize large data sets quickly and easily using simple commands in R.

## Goals

* Start/finish step 2 script
* Begin to explore our data in R using ggplot2
* Discuss basics of Tidy data and the reshape2 package
* Talk briefly about color palettes in R
* Filter data to remove lowly expressed genes
* Normalize data

## Code

## Software

[Sip](https://sipapp.io/) - I discussed this simple but excellent color picking software in class. The program costs about $10, but provides a convenient and powerful way to assemble color palettes for use in R.

## Reading

[Tidy Data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) - Hadley Wickham (author of Tidyverse packages and Chief Scientist at RStudio) describes the philosophy of tidy data in this paper.
