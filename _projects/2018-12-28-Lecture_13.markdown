description: Now that you're comfortable with bulk RNA-seq data analysis, we'll shift our focus to the rapidly developing landscape of single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq).  In this lecture, you'll learn about the underlying technology and we'll demonstrate how to process raw single cell data for importing into R/bioconductor.
